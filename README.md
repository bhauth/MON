# Markdown Object Notation


## purpose

This is a sketch of a new human-readable data format. MON is meant to be easily converted to/from JSON and related formats, but be easier for humans to read and write with a text editor. It has similar goals to TOML and YAML, but is meant to handle **deeply nested** data in a more readable way than those formats.

I do think MON is better than current formats, but usually, new programming/data languages need backing from a major institution or celebrity-engineer to get established. However, you can use the code here to convert MON to JSON today, and that might be easier than writing JSON other ways.


## current implementation

An initial implementation is available [here](https://github.com/bhauth/MON). Usage:

- install Node if you haven't
- cd \[directory\]
- npm install
- node monTool.js \[one or more files\]

That generates .json files from the input files.

Note that Node takes hundreds of milliseconds to start up. Bun starts up ~2x as fast as Node, but either way you want to batch processing.


## VS existing formats

### JSON

Deep nesting with parentheses is hard to read. People aren't good at keeping track of where in the hierarchy they are. That's why people use indentation, but then either you have significant whitespace (eg Python) or 2 systems with potential mismatch. Also, deep nesting means indentation takes up a lot of space, and it's hard to see the exact depth of deep indentation.

Lisp has the same problem, which is why it's not the most popular programming language. Instead of using () for everything, it's better to use multiple labels for demarcating blocks to indicate what's starting and ending.

JSON doesn't have comments, and I think it should.

I don't like being forced to quote keys.


### YAML

YAML is complex, whitespace-sensitive, and does implicit conversions that can cause bugs. Various people have written [posts](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/) about [problems](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell) using YAML can cause.

### TOML

Tom Preston-Werner, the founder of GitHub, recognized the issues with deep nesting, and designed TOML to avoid them. Here's an example of TOML from its site:

	[servers]

	[servers.alpha]
	ip = "10.0.0.1"
	role = "frontend"

	[servers.beta]
	ip = "10.0.0.2"
	role = "backend"

The problem with that approach is, repeating long sequences is bad. Suppose the example above is deeply nested inside other stuff. Then, it becomes:

	[many.levels.deep.nested.stuff.servers.alpha]
	ip = "10.0.0.1"
	role = "frontend"

	[many.levels.deep.nested.stuff.servers.beta]
	ip = "10.0.0.2"
	role = "backend"

You probably see the problem here. I still consider that an improvement over editing JSON as text, but it's not ideal.


## Markdown

There's already a popular format that solves some of the above problems: Markdown. The only problem is, there's no standardized way to use it as a data container.

Markdown is generally credited to [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), but personally I'd give more credit to [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). Aaron is better-known for co-founding Reddit and for how he died, but he also designed [atx](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/intro.html), which has all the key elements of Markdown. Personally, I think the design of Gruber's additions is more questionable.

So, this post and design is dedicated to Aaron Swartz.


## MON features

Let's look at how test_data.mon is processed.

    - cd \[directory\]
    - node monTool.js test_data.mon

That produces a test_data.json file. Let's compare it to the input.


### key-value pairs

	root_item = ["nested", ["bracket", ["array"]]]
    
    ðŸ¡º 
    
    "root_item": [
      "nested",
      [
        "bracket",
        [
          "array"
        ]
      ]
    ],
    
We can use key-value pairs, and data in nested brackets.

### quoted keys

    'single quotes' = "allow for spaces in keys"
        
        ðŸ¡º
    
    "single quotes": "allow for spaces in keys",

Keys may be quoted with single quotes. Strings must be quoted with double quotes.

### section headers

    # alpha
    "A"
    
    # beta
    bools = [true, false]
    'null' = null
    
    ðŸ¡º 
    
    "alpha": "A",
    "beta": {
      "bools": [
        true,
        false
      ],
      "null": null
    },

We can put one or more values or key-value pairs under # headers. If there are multiple values, the first one is taken.

Like in JSON, values can be a string, a float, true, false, or null.

Subsections are added to their parent section as keys, so only sections that are empty or have key-value pairs may have subsections.

### text blocks

    #" Text Block
    You can freely use
    symbols like " and = in this text.
    
    ## nested text
    can go in these too.

        ðŸ¡º
    
    "Text Block": "You can freely use\nsymbols like \" and = in this text.\n# nested text\ncan go in these too.",

Adding **"** to the end of a **#** header makes that section and all its subsections a text block. Subsection headers are trimmed by the starting level, to allow embedding arbitrary Markdown in them.

### comment blocks

    #/ comment block
    
    ## Text here is ignored.
    Until hitting a lower-level header.

Adding **/** to the end of a **#** header makes that section and all its subsections a comment block.

### nesting in existing items

    # gamma
    g = "is for gamma"
    
    # gamma.deeply.nested.items
    multi_line_string = "this...
    is...
    nested."
      
    ðŸ¡º 
    
    "gamma": {
      "g": "is for gamma",
      "deeply": {
        "nested": {
          "items": {
            "multi_line_string": "this...\nis...\nnested."
          }
        }
      }
    },

We can define a section, then later put data inside it that's deeply nested, as above. Header names are split by " **.** ".

Nesting with headers can potentially escape schemas, so it's only allowed if **trust â‰¥ 0**.

### appending to arrays

    # epsilon
    
    ## array.[]
    a = "building"
    b = "an"
    
    ## array.[]
    c = "array"
    d = "up"
          
    ðŸ¡º 

    "epsilon": {
      "array": [
        {
          "a": "building",
          "b": "an"
        },
        {
          "c": "array",
          "d": "up"
        }
      ]
    },

When a section is labeled **foo.[]** as above, its contents are appended to an array in **foo**.

### nested arrays and array insertion

    # zeta
    // This is a comment.
    // Commas produce nested values.
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
      , 2.2
    - 3
      , 3.3
    
    # zeta.0
    "replaced zero in zeta"
              
    ðŸ¡º 
    
    "zeta": [
      "replaced zero in zeta",
      1,
      [
        2,
        2.2
      ],
      [
        3,
        3.3
      ]
    ],

A line starting with **//** is a single-line comment.

Dashes produce arrays. Using commas after dashes produces nested sub-arrays.

In Javascript, strings of numbers are converted to numeric array indices when used as keys. So, we can insert data in arrays defined above.

### dittos and templates

    # people
    ##/ templates are not output
    ##= employee_template
    role = "employee"
    
    // ditto copies above
    ##= bob
    status = "active"
    
    ##= joe
    
    #= people_copy

    ðŸ¡º

    "people": {
      "bob": {
        "role": "employee",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "joe": {
        "role": "employee"
      }
    },
    "people_copy": {
      "bob": {
        "role": "employee",
        "status": "active"
      },
      "joe": {
        "role": "employee"
      }
    },

Using **##=** makes a section a template (if it's a first subsection) or a ditto (otherwise). A template is not output. A ditto copies the most recent non-ditto section, and can have extra data added.

Ditto sections can produce exponential amounts of data, so they're only allowed if **trust â‰¥ 1**.

### code blocks

    # code blocks
    
    ##; logging
    console.log("Send a message in a bottle.");
    
    ## x
    10
    
    ##; 2x
    return this.x * 2;
    
    ##; using root
    return `Bob's status is ${root.people.bob.status}.`;

    ðŸ¡º

    "code blocks": {
      "x": 10,
      "2x": 20,
      "using root": "Bob's status is active."
    },

Using **##;** makes a section a code block. Code blocks are only executed if **trust â‰¥ 2**.

Code blocks can access their parent section as **this** and if **trust â‰¥ 3** they can access the root object as **root**.

The above code block also executes a **console.log**. If it was copied by a ditto, the message would be printed twice.

### tags

Suppose you want to apply some code to multiple blocks, based on their type. We can do that with tags. A tag block is marked with **##: tag_name** and code in it is applied to every section with that tag. Sections can have multiple tags. Tag names are global. Tags must use " **:** " with spaces.

    #: some_tags
    
    ##: squared
    this.x2 = this.x ** 2;
    
    ##: cubed
    this.x3 = this.x ** 3;
    
    # numbers
    
    ## square_me : squared
    x = 10
    
    ðŸ¡º

    "numbers": {
      "square_me": {
        "x": 10,
        "x2": 100
      }
    },

Here, the code in **squared** is applied to every block with the type **squared**.

### subtags

Suppose we want to automatically apply tags to subsections, based on their parent section's type and the subsection names. We can do that with subtags.

    #: funNumbers
    ## squares : myType
    ### * : squared
    ## cubes.[] : cubed
    
    # squared_numbers : funNumbers
    
    ## squares
    ### s1
    x = 6
    ### s2
    
    ðŸ¡º

    "squared_numbers": {
      "squares": {
        "s1": {
          "x": 6,
          "x2": 36
        },
        "s2": {
          "x": 5,
          "x2": 25
        }
      }
    },

Let's go through what that means.

    #: funNumbers
    ## squares : myType

In sections tagged **funNumbers**, if there's a subsection named **squares**, apply tag **myType** to it.

    ## squares : myType
    ### * : squared

In sections tagged **myType**, if there's **any subsection** (" **\*** " matches any section name), apply tag **squared** to it.

### array subtags

If we want to apply a tag to every element of an array, we can do that by adding " **.[]** " to the section name. To match any array subsection, we can use " **\*.[]** ".

    # cubed_numbers : funNumbers
    
    ## cubes
    - x = 4
    - x = 3
    
    ## cubes.[]
    x = 2
    ## cubes.[]
    x = 1
    
    ðŸ¡º

    "cubed_numbers": {
      "cubes": [
        {
          "x": 4,
          "x3": 64
        },
        {
          "x": 3,
          "x3": 27
        },
        {
          "x": 2,
          "x3": 8
        },
        {
          "x": 1,
          "x3": 1
        }
      ]
    }


## trust levels

**trust** is a parsing function parameter. Trust levels are defined by what input data must not be allowed to do, as follows:

* 3 : (no restrictions)
* 2 : access data outside itself
* 1 : run javascript code
* 0 : cause excessive memory or time usage
* -1 : avoid schemas being applied


## future plans

### file handling

To process a folder of MON files using another MON file as a schema, the code would be something like:

    MON.load([
      [schema_path, {trust: 0}],
      [data_directory, {type: "type_in_schema", trust: 0}]
    ])

The type of that would be something like:

    type inputFile = string | [string, Record<string, any>];
    type validationErrors = any[];
    type loaderType = (
      input: inputFile[]
    ) => [any, validationErrors];

The array of (files / directories) is loaded in order, and each can have a type assigned to it from previously loaded files. Untrusted files have more-limited schema features.

Since this is using Typescript already, the same function could also handle JSON files.

File data can go inside an object with that filename. If we want a file with data that goes deep inside another file, files can have names such as:

* base.mon
* base.some.nesting.mon
* base/more/nesting.mon


### logo / ç´‹ç« 

Since the name is MON, maybe it could use a logo like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Family_crest_hanawachigai.png).
